## Getting Started

(Unique product ID) Most of the inventory management systems (such as a retail store) maintain records for all
available products, and for that, these systems require a unique ID for each product. This unique product ID is
composed of various attributes, including product category, product code, supplier code, manufacturing year, and
stock reference number.
